	In 1979, Redstone (1923) survived a Boston hotel fire. In 1987, Redstone won voting control of Viacom. I have an obsessive competitive spirit. Determination, physical or any other kind, is the key to survival. It’s fierce determination with a great deal of energy and a great deal of focus. Determination, Resourcefulness, a certain disregard for rules. The central thing is to get control of an asset, not necessarily cheaply. A lot of people are able to understand and work that formula of buying cheap and selling high. But the formula for the very rich is to get control of an asset and enhance its value. <br><br>

	Nick Vujicic: <br><br>

	You create your own universe as you go along. What you think and feel about will be attracted to you. It’s a lie to think you're not good enough. It's a lie to think you're not worth anything. I love my life, because I’ve seen my purpose. I have the choice to be angry in God for what I don’t have or be thankful for what you do have. As long as I try, there’s always a chance of getting up. It’s not the end until you give up. Failure is not important, how you overcome it is. Consider it pure joy, whenever you face trials. I am gonna try again and again, because the moment I give up, is the moment I fail. His belief is that God can use any willing heart to do his work.
